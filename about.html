                <h1>About Programmer</h1>
                <p class="p1">Welcome to Bijou Bliss! We're a group of four friends who are all passionate about 
                    creating and sharing beautiful jewelry with others. While we may be new to the industry,
                    we're dedicated to providing exceptional products and service to our customers.
                    We believe that jewelry should be affordable and accessible to everyone, and that it 
                    should be a form of self-expression and creativity. Our pieces are designed with a 
                    focus on simplicity, elegance, and quality craftsmanship.
                </p>
                <p class="p2"> As founders, we all have different backgrounds and interests that inform our work. 
                    We have our own share to make the shop known for its crafts and pieces.
                    Together, we make a great team and are committed to creating a shop that offers beautiful,
                    high-quality pieces at affordable prices. We believe that everyone deserves to own a piece
                    of jewelry that makes them feel confident and beautiful. Thank you for choosing to shop 
                    with us, and we look forward to helping you find the perfect piece.
